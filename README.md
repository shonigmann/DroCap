Code cleanup, documentation, and installation instructions are a work in progress, and will happen as I have time (or as the need arises). For the time being, please refer to my Master's thesis on the topic for reference, available [here](https://github.com/shonigmann/DroCap/blob/main/docs/WhereToPerchThesis.pdf). If you have any questions or suggested improvements, please submit an issue.
