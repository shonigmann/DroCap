# DroCap
Algorithms and simulations developed to assist in the placement of remote, in-situ, perching-drone based motion capture networks. 

Code cleanup and documentation is a work in progress, and will happen as I have time (or as the need arises). For the time being, please refer to my Master's thesis on the topic for reference, available (here)[]. If this work is relevent and useful to your work, citations are appreciated. If you have any questions or suggested improvements, please submit an issue.
